        p Sail-o-bots try to combine but also spare concepts, perceptions and even basic human need based on Maslow's hierarchy. They are the mischief of the sea, have their own tiny boats to sail but they prefer to stand still, and watch the sunset. Until the next day comes, Sail-o-bots wait, they do not eat, they do not sleep, that's why they are on edge from time to time. Do not judge them quickly. Each bot has its own messages if you want to take or they are just shiny stuff you can stare at. Sail-o-bots cannot stay at a same style, that is who they are, they might be called inconsistent, but it has advantages, having multiple disciplines is really important for them, they will never stop trying to discover more. They will always be going back and forward around several versions, do not think that they will stop at one since they discover themselves, which is probably never.<br>

        p The SeaHamDAO Manifesto
          | Introducing the SeaHamDAO - a community of artists, art collectors and art enthusiasts bringing together the best people in the NFT world.
          br
          | SeaHamDAO will amass a collection of assets that are highly scarce, then create content that reinforces their social significance and strengthens desires for these assets. Drawing inspiration from NounsDAO, all holders of assets have voting power.The treasury is controlled exclusively via governance by holders.
          | WHY? A place for Ham holders to exchange knowledge and discuss collections and individual pieces from the NFT art world. Lets unite, align and grow together. 
          | Also why: We need to unite the pochis and all hams under one token for a true DAO (*as many of you know the hams are unable to access the private discord channels as of yet).
          br
          | HOW? Sensei Che has invited the Hamily to Foundation and given the community three timeless Hams to auction off to kick start the DAO. The proceeds will seed the treasury, which will be governed by all members of the community going forward. Community votes will be tiered with a point system where Craft Holders will have 10votes/craft, Hams 5 votes, pochi 2 and Nobodies also 2. TBC
          | A sliced Ham from ACK will give the community a token which will unify all holders under one access token for discord: $hamily?
          br
          | MISSION? The main mission is to grow the Treasury by acquire more ETH, more SEAHAMs and more rare NFTs, to finance che yu wu as an artist and allocate budget for new collabs or developers to build out infrastructure. Simultaneously the goal is to grow the community & governance participation, through collabs with other artists, marketing campaigns and partnerships with other DAOS and collectors.
